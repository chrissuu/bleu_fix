### Introduction
In this post, I'd like to talk about a very central "problem" to scientific discovery, but I suppose the same ideas could apply towards the humanities. 

This "problem" is the very question of the growing complexity in the sciences. In the past century or so, scientific subjects and the study of them evolved from breadth to depth. As "majors" / degree-granting universities adopted various types of educational departments, students more now than ever, focus most of their time and effort into very niche areas of their fields, and it's not that difficult to believe that this "nichification" will only grow more prominent within the years to come. 

In academia especially, the idea of being a Ph.D. student in simply "math" is a vast understatement to the very small subset of mathematics in which they become engrossed in. 

As an exaggeration, suppose we took a journey one thousand years into the past and compared mathematics then and now. The study of prime numbers has evolved to analytic number theory, which uses ideas from analysis to study the property of numbers; the study of geometry has evolved to various programs and departments in algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and others. Physics has evolved from the study of "light" to high-energy particle physics. These aren't simply long and difficult sounding names -- though the foundational ideas are similar; the concepts themselves have become more specific, more precise, and ultimately, more complex. 

### A Poll of arXiv
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) is a collection of research paper pre-prints that are available, open source, to anyone in the world. 

Let's take a quick dive into astrophysics and the most recent papers that were submitted to arXiv. 

**Astrophysics**
 - [Optimization of muonium yield in perforated silica aerogel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00222)
 - [High-statistics measurement of Collins and Sivers asymmetries for transversely polarised deuterons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00309)
 - [Training toward significance with the decorrelated event classifier transformer neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00428)
 - [Non-prompt J/ψ production in proton-proton collisions with ALICE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00868)
 - [Observation of (3810) in e+e−→hadrons and Improved Measurements of the Resonance Parameters of (3760) and (3780)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00878)


It's not an understatement to say that the above could really only be understood properly by the ambitious or those professionally studying the relevant fields. These names weren't cherry-picked, rather, they were simply the first titles I came across under the January 2024 arXiv preprints for Astrophysics. 

### Is Growing Complexity a Problem?
There are two main concerns I will attempt to raise when answering this question. I hope that as you read this section, you read it not with the present in mind, but have your mind focused towards the future of education and academia. For the sake of argument, we will consider Astrophysics as our prototypical subject. 

**The First Conundrum** 
The first: suppose the case where complexity of astrophysics continues to grow and continues to be more specific. If we make the naive assumption that the number of people going into higher education remains constant, then clearly, the number of professionals matriculating into programs with these very specific subfields of astrophysics will become smaller and smaller as time goes on and on. 

Because academia fundamentally relies on peer revision to maintain the quality of research, a smaller population of people that can recognize the quality of good research poses a serious problem: the amount of good research that can be published will consequently decrease!
